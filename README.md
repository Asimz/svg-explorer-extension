# SVG Viewer Extension for Windows Explorer

Extension module for Windows Explorer to render SVG thumbnails, so that you can have an overview of your SVG files.

## Installation
From _[Releases](https://github.com/maphew/svg-explorer-extension/releases)_ download and run appropriate binary for your system. Note: you probably need an _unsigned_ version as the signed binary certificate was revoked (#29) around Dec 2019.

Then kill `explorer.exe` and icon cache
([ref](https://superuser.com/questions/342052/how-to-get-svg-thumbnails-in-windows-explorer)):
   
    TASKKILL /IM explorer* /F
    DEL "%localappdata%\IconCache.db" /A
    explorer.exe
   
You can just simply use the provided binary installers. Make sure you download the right architecture (the 32 bit installer will run on a 64 bit system, but the extension will not function).

## svg-explorer-extension - developer note
This repo was imported from https://svgextension.codeplex.com/

I imported the svg-explorer-extension from CodePlex posted here to GitHub because I use the extension and I didn't want to lose access to it when CodePlex shut down in 2017. 

I'm primarily a python guy and am ill equipped to maintaining this project. So if you know C++ and have some time to spare, please feel free to take over! In the meantime I'm happy to merge pull requests for those who care to offer drive-by fixin's but can't vet them for quality or completeness. ;-)
